Violators, who do so, risk impoundment of the vehicle(s) and prosecution by the local police. These vehicles brought in by renters or visitors, with or without Las Conchas stickers, will be refused entry at the Guard Gate. Violators who bypass the Guard Gate do so at the risk of impoundment of the vehicle(s) and prosecution by the local police. The Association and the city of Puerto Peñasco enacted this ordinance to preserve the desert environment which was rapidly being destroyed by off road vehicles. At no time are any of these vehicles to be ridden on the beach side of Las Conchas (with the exception of the Las Conchas Guards patrolling the area and enforcing the rules).

Maybe there's a deal on that Mexico beach vacation rental you've had your eye on for a long time. It always pays to watch for what specials we have going on. Get a few dollars off your Rocky Point vacation rental and spend what you saved on something exciting like your first scuba diving excursion. Mexico's Rocky Point has long been a spring break haven, but keep in mind there are other times of the year when a vacation rental in Puerto Peñasco can be found for a little less.
