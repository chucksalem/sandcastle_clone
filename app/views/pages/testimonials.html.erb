It served all our needs and it was very close to downtown like we were hoping for. Overall we had a great time and we loved our stay at the Casita de Sue√±os.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="persons-words">&ldquo;Our stay was for 5 days. The house was well maintained and there were no unexpected problems. There was no need to call for any maintenance.
Great little place for 4. Very cozy. Everyone was very satisfied with the simple design of the house and the great beds in the bedroom. Such soft and plush beds. They really made the vacation even better.
The people at Oceano were great but what was nice was not having to fiddle with any problems in the home you could see they took great care to make the home a rock solid vacation home. Close to everything in town.&rdquo;</p>
