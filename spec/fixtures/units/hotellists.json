I do NOT recommend if you're travelling with elderly due to all the stairs. The only thing I'd recommend adding to the house are some railings along the wall for the second set of stairs leading to the 2nd and 3rd bedroom. We had a minor fall injury. If it storms, be prepared to pull out the shovel to level out the dirt road in front of the property for in/out vehicle access; The rain will create some minor damage to the dirt road. There is a security guard posted from 6pm to 6am that monitors and only allows residences in and out, which gives you a safe comfort feeling. The beach is across the street, which gives you an amazing view to wake up to. The outdoor shower was very helpful when returning from the beach.The home has lots of ceiling fans and a A/C unit that works well. Overall, I was satisfied with this property. I would stay again.

All you need to bring are some umbrellas for shade while on the beach.  This is the 3rd or 4the time we have stayed at Ole and it has always met our needs.  We have found Oceano very professional and accommodating throughout the entire rental process.  We ate at the property for all meals except for a lunch at El Chino's taco stand located on a corner in the downtown area.  When stop at the Circle K on the right hand side of the road right before the Las Conchas turnoff and get ice and flour tortillas.  This time the tortillas were so perfect we were truly amazed.

I went by the pictures posted on the website. I took my young family for a weekend getaway.  This condo was absolutely perfect! Exactly how the pictures depicted. The beach was feet away from the back patio, all kitchen items were included, which came in very handy. The only issues we had was that bedroom 2 had no electricity. The company did address the issue timely, however, the air condition stopped working over night and shut the electricity again. It sure made that bedroom inhabitable for my kids.

The house was great once again this year. However a couple issues this year were disappointing. Minor issue, there was no barbeque grill as stated. We had planned to cook on the grill for most of the week but were not able to do so, we adapted. Second which is the more frustrating issue, every single morning at 7:30 AM construction crews began working on the adjacent house, running tile saws and using hammers to clean out their mortar buckets. The construction continued each day until sundown (6:00/6:30 PM). This made for a less than peaceful vacation. I would think since this home is under an HOA there would be time regulations for construction work. I would definitely recommend this property, provided the construction has been completed on the adjacent house."},{"title":"Good location","city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","comment":"House has potential, but needs some updates.  Things like sliding doors, refrigerator, and oven did not work well.   Location is great, beach is great.\u003cbr/\u003eWe had brought food to grill, but could not locate the grill as advertised.

The screen doors do not lock nor slide very well so the air conditioning has to stay on at night to cool the bedrooms.  It would be nice to lock a sliding screen door, open the slider and enjoy the sound of the ocean instead of the AC unit.  \u003cbr/\u003eThere is Wi-Fi but no satellite TV.

We found the home in good shape with a few minor issues (one stove burner didn't work). The beds were comfortable, the temperature was perfect. The sun was warm and the water cool. We swam and tide-pooled ALL day long:) We were there on a spring break week and had the beach almost to ourselves. \u003cbr/\u003eGrocery shopping was easy at the Ley Express and we were able to buy anything we could possibly want from all the various vendors on the beach. Wonderful week away!"},{"title":"Extended Weekend Stay in Rocky Point","city":"Napa","state":"CA","comment":"House was clean, neat, and ready for us.

But, it is comfortable and the location is unbeatable!"},{"title":"First time in Las Conchas","city":"","state":"","comment":"We really enjoyed our stay at the Playa Romantica beachfront home. It had all the amenities we needed plus more. We brought our kayaks and was so conveniently close to the water that we ocean kayaked everyday when the tide was up and when the tide was down we would go down with a bucket and flip rocks to find crabs,clams and oysters to eat. We also found different species of starfish and many other strange marine life. We brought our fishing poles to fish off the shore...we didn't catch our corvina,trigger or shark but alot of poisonous puffer fish  which we let go but all was in great fun! We even horseback on the beach took tons of pictures and video with our water camera's to share on youtube. We also picked up choice seashells so my wife can use in her crafts like making a box frame picture and windshime. We brought our own fire pit to burn wood at night and keep beach clean and fire contained. One thing we loved to do is drink coffee from the patio to watch dolphins play right in front of us in the morning sun! We loved this place so much that we are planning to come back next year...thank you Oceano Rentals for making our vacation so memorable.

We didn't spend much time in the living room but if that is something you would like to do, you might really like a furniture change.  Showers were great.  We all really liked the split 2 bedroom floor plan as it gave some privacy and quiet when needed.  Both BR's had an amazing view of the ocean."},{"title":"If beach houses were food, this would be comfort food.","city":"Tucson","state":"Arizona","comment":"This is our 2nd time staying at Playa Romantica. It's perfect for a family or close friends of 4-6.  It may be due for a little renovation soon, but if you're like us - simple, easygoing people just looking for a cozy spot right on the beach - you probably won't mind the little quirks (outdoor shower had no pressure, a towel rack came off the wall, one wobbly dining chair...).  And if there are any bigger issues, one call to Oceano gets it fixed quickly!  I'm not giving 5 stars on cleanliness because the ceiling fans were dusty.  Overall, it is a great place to have a fun and relaxing time with friends and family."},{"title":"April getaway","city":"Avondale","state":"Az","comment":"We had a great time"},{"title":"Very Nice","city":"El Centro","state":"CA","comment":"Comfortable and the best view you can get"},{"title":"Love Playa Romantica","city":"Peoria","state":"AZ","comment":"This house is the most comfortable setup for two small families especiallyuif you bring kids.

Last time we stayed in one of the large condos further down the beach. We really liked the layout and location of this property as we were with another couple. It was clean but needs a maintenance person. The sliding screen door on one bedroom doesn't slide and the roller fell off, the Weber grill is so rusted that the handle is barely holding on. The outdoor lights are hanging by the wires. The cd player doesn't work. When we checked out we started telling the property management company these things but they wrote nothing down or showed little interest in what we were saying. We thought that they would want to know so things could get fixed. \u003cbr/\u003e We still had a good time and made the best of it. We stayed three days of which the first two were very windy.

Large enough for 3  families. Super clean, and updated furniture. Comfortable and cozy. We had an issue with our water not running on the last day and I think from the time we told them from the time they had someone out to the house was maybe 20 minutes!! Fixed right away. Would highly recommend!!"},{"title":"Awesome Family Vacation","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","comment":"The location of this house is perfect with just steps to the sand \u0026#38; ocean.  The house itself was magnificent with each bedroom tastefully decorated.  The kitchen was fully equipped with everything that we needed.  The gas BBQ was wonderful.  Plenty of room for the 8 adults and 2 children of my family.  The outside patios (upper \u0026#38; lower) where we spent most of our time provided awesome views of the ocean.  Had a small problem with the sliding glass door which management handled promptly.  It was very clean \u0026#38; definitely would be someplace I would stay again.  I also recommend taking advantage of the local street vendors who come by for some delicious authentic Mexican food.

Its was very cold, unusual for Rocky Point at this time of year, and the property did not have heat. Fireplace only drew properly when door open. Water pressure was non- existent and garage door was broken. Overall property needs some TLC."},{"title":"Rocky Point Paradise","city":"Goodyear","state":"AZ","comment":"This Rocky Point Paradise Vacation home was absolutely beautiful and decorated with all the Mexican charm and wonder of the heart of Mexico!  With exquisite direct access to the beach, you are just a hop, skip and jump from the sand and the Sea of Cortez.  The views and sunset were amazing.  This spacious comfortable home accommodated our large family well.  We were glad to have a rental car as this remote location is about 15-25 minutes away from most popular destinations in Mexico (the Rodeo Dr/Cholla Mall, Old Port, Cet-Mar Sea Aquarium, ATV rentals, \u0026#38; Wrecked on the Reef Bar \u0026#38; Grill).  We let the management company know the Direct TV satellite audio wasn't working, \u0026#38; about the cracked mirrored closet doors, the minimal hot water \u0026#38; water flow in the beautifully tiled showers, the missing cold water faucet in the bathroom, the missing TP roll holder, and several ceiling fan lights were out in the breathtaking great room, as well as the kitchen lights would randomly blink and turn off for extended periods of time. The home was very clean, beautifully decorated with Mexican accents and tile work, very comfortable beds \u0026#38; plush bedding.  We would have enjoyed more plates \u0026#38; cups to host the 10 people accommodation the home boasts.  There is a perfect mother-in-law suite off the main home that sleeps 2 and has it's own bathroom and kitchen ensemble.  The home also has a outdoor loft patio that directly overlooks the ocean \u0026#38; shoreline- like a bit of heaven on earth!  The winding spiral staircase was gorgeous.  We enjoyed the beach vendors offering silver and other inexpensive goods.  The management company was easy to access and even left the key in an envelope for our after-hour arrival!  They speak English well and were very welcoming.  We recommend this beautifully decorated home for your next Rocky Point stay!"},{"title":"December in Rocky Point","city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","comment":"Very nice - may need a little \"TLC\" but was very well appointed and fully equipped.

The views were awesome! The windows in the living room had a beautiful view of the Sea of Cortez, the balcony and rooftop patio also had beautiful views of the sea and the community.

It is inside of a gated community, with two guards on site at all times. Parking is a little questionable as you will be parked on the street.

The beach was not Rocky, and you can walk around easily without shoes.  We had a awesome views of the sunset from the house, and decent views of the ocean from the house.

Description","description":"Spectacular is the only way to describe this 4000 square foot, two story beach front home in the gated community of Las Conchas. Sleeping quarters consist of four large bedrooms. Artistic touches and walls of tinted glass mysteriously bring the Sea of Cortez to this home.

It was clean and it accommodated our party. The issue is that I have not received my deposit back. We rented in June 2016 and we were told our deposit would be refunded within 2 weeks. I called Oceano the beginning of August and spoke to Jose who said he would release my deposit $250 and it should be in my account within 5 business days. We are now in the month of September and still no deposit. I  have called Oceano Beach Home Rentals and their phone rings without any answer. I'm shocked that I have to chase my deposit when this has never happened before. I hope to hear from Oceano soon and they refund my deposit since we left the home clean and kept our end of the bargain. I know they have had a number of staff changes and I hope this was an error since we have had great experiences in the past renting from Oceano."},{"title":"Coming back next year!","city":"laveen","state":"AZ","comment":"We really liked the house and we are sure coming back next year! I read the reviews and was kind of scared of people said, but the beach is not that far from the house, yeah you have to walk a little bit to get down to the beach it was not a problem! The \"4th room\" with the sofa bed was not as bad, the people who slept there didn't complain about it at all, plus the view is awesome to weak up too. The property was clean, we always had water even tho they warned us about. It did have a good sound system but i would off wished it was upgraded to connect a an AUX cable or connect through bluetooth.  But other then that we loved the location and the house! We are sure coming back pretty soon!"},{"title":"Beautiful home with fantastic panoramic views.","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"I have rented many home at Las Conchas and this is one of my favorite four bedroom rentals.  The great room was huge and had excellent views of the beach and sea. The dining area and master bedroom views were equally spectacular.  The only disappointment was that the forth bedroom offered a couch that converted to a queen size bed.  The bed was very uncomfortable and would have much preferred a regular queen or king bed instead of the convertible couch.  If I should come back to this home I would definitely bring along a blow up mattress for better comfort.  I would recommend this home but be aware of the convertible couch,  Ouch!

We enjoyed being right on the beach. The house was perfect. We bought seafood two nights from the fish markets and had sea food feasts made in the kitchen and on the outside grill. The AC kept it comfortable dispite the heat. The house was clean and comfortable. Great view from the patio. Relaxing. The management was excellent. There was a problem with the shower head and they fixed it that day. The house ran out of water. Within hours the truck was there to fill the tank. Recommend this place to anyone looking for a great retreat. "},{"title":"Perfect get-a-way","city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","comment":"The casita is perfect for four friends or a family with kids.

The weather was so cold.  Didn't get to spend any time at the beach.  If you rent this house, make sure you turn on the water heater.  We went a day and half with no showers because we didn't know this had to be done.  The location is kind of far away from the Fish Market.  Since we wanted to drink we didn't want to drive so we had to get a taxi at $20 a time to take us there.

It is behind the main beach front property, but the shared yard is great, there is a huge patio, and you can still see and step easily to the shore.  The amount of space was perfect for the two of us (perhaps too much, since we didn't even go in the second bedroom).  The bedroom was very comfortable.  The location is very close to the entrance to Las Conchas, with easy access.  We went into town for food and shopping a few times a day and swam and lounged around on the beach the rest of the time."},{"title":"awsome","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"awsome"},{"title":"Great Place","city":"Chandler","state":"AZ","comment":"We would recommend this place to everyone and will stay again.

Here it goes again...\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe property is great.  If you are looking at a rental in Las Conchas/Rocky Point for the beach, the access, the patio, or the property overall - this is the place to rent.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe rental is the 'guest house,' right behind the 'main house' - which is on the beach.  From the 'guest house' you have a clear view and walk directly to the beach - you don't even need to bring your shoes!  Also, this property is right at the part of the beach where the rocks end and the sand starts - that means at high tide you don't have to worry about stubbing your toes on the rocks that are on much of the rest of the beach.  Also, at low tide, you are right next to all the cool tidal pools (we found star fish, octopuses!, tons of hermit crabs).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThere is one main room (a kitchen/living area), then two bedrooms off of that.  One of the bedrooms has a bathroom, whereas the other bathroom is off of the kitchen area.  The house has everything you need (towels, silverware, pots and pans, good AC).  There are large windows in each room, which makes it really pretty to look out into the nicely landscaped yard.  The patio is fantastic - probably one of my favorite things.  It's very large and covered - so even when it was 100 outside, it felt nice and breezy under the patio.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOkay, I don't want you to think they are paying me to write this.  Some of the stuff felt a little dated.  For example, the two lounge chairs on the patio had seen better days.  The kitchen drawer for silverware needed to be repaired... But that is me LOOKING for something to critique.  Think about it - are you considering renting this place for the location, the beach, and the patio, or are you renting it for lounge chairs and kitchen cabinetry!?\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eYes, rent this place - you won't regret it."},{"title":"Time for Quiet and Family","city":"Gilbert","state":"AZ","comment":"We enjoyed our stay and the guest house. All was in good order. We would recommend a better repair on the sliding glass door as the lock slipped and we were locked out for about 30 minutes until the guard located someone with a key to let us in.

We went out to town and came back at 5 after 5. Nothing was fixed. I went back to the office and they were closed. \u003cbr/\u003eEventually we got the bathroom open ourselves, and the stove was never fixed.

A/C, Wifi, amenities all great. We had a hard time finding the house number in the evening, but it is easy to get to Las Conchas otherwise. We would recommend this wholeheartedly and Oscar at Oceano was extremely helpful with recommendations, places to purchase local fish, etc. The beach directly in front of the house was extremely rocky and good for looking at tidal pools, not swimming, but a few miles further down in Las Conchas there is just sand and tons of access to the beaches.

My only complaint is that the internet does not reach the outdoor room?

Mis √∫nicas quejas son que no llegaba el internet al cuarto de afuera, las cobijas que estaban guardadas estaban un poquito sucias, y los espejos tambi√©n ya que se pod√≠an ver mensajes de hu√©spedes pasados, aunque realmente estoy siendo un poco exigente, todas estas fueron peque√±eces. Me encant√≥ la ubicaci√≥n, mucha seguridad y la gente de oc√©ano fue muy amable. Regresar√≠a y recomendar√≠a este condominio 100% :)"},{"title":"Las conchas","city":"Colorado springs","state":"CO","comment":"Everything was great!

The house was beautiful and in very good condition. The central air conditioning worked great! The AC was a big issue because we were there August 1st and it was extremely hot and humid. In fact we moved to this house because the first property we stayed at was very hot, the AC was inadequate. The house was very clean and well stocked. Wifi worked great and there is satellite TV but we did not turn it on. The house in on the beach steps from the water, depending on tide. At high tide there is plenty of Sandy bottom beach. At low tide lots of tide pools among the rocks.\u003cbr/\u003eThere were a couple of small maintenance issues I informed the management company, Oceano about.\u003cbr/\u003eI would definitely stay here again.

For over 20 years we have enjoyed the peace and beauty of this place, the spellbinding sunsets and the charmof the city. As frequent visitors to Puerto Penasco, it became impossible for us to ignore the plight of many of the street dogs suffering from illness, starvation and sometimes outright cruelty. On several occasions we took abandoned, sick and starving dogs back to the United States to be rehabilitated and to find loving \"forever\" homes.\n A few years ago we encountered Barb Mumbach, who operates Barb's Dog Rescue about five miles north of town. She is an incredible woman who has struggled to help these poor dogs in any way that she can . She cares for them at her rescue providing food, medicine, and lots of love. She has also arranged for spaying and neutering, as well as many successful adoptions to the United States.\n  Your choice to stay at Casa Playa is a significant benefit to these dogs because we have pledge 100% of all rental revenues from Casa Playa to Barb's Dog Rescue.\nI hope you have a chance to stop by and visit Barb, and even consider a contribution toward her wonderful efforts.\n  To the world, Barb is a dog rescuer. To each of these needy dogs, she is their world."},{"title":"Driving Directions","description":null},{"title":"Room Description","description":"The master bedroom with magnificent ocean view has a king size bed, wood-burning fireplace, boveda ceiling, and full private bath complete with jacuzzi and double sinks."}]},"name":"Extraordinary five bedroom beach home","num_floors":1,"occupancy":10,"position":{"latitude":31.286328,"longitude":-113.476109},"type":"house","reviews":[{"title":"October 13-17 Stay at Casa Playa","city":"Tucson","state":"Arizona","comment":"Casa Playa was very nice with awesome furnishings and roomy patio  All of the rooms were large with nice bathrooms.

Everything was absolutely wonderful, EXCEPT, we had no water in the house for the first five hours after we arrived and again no water on the night before we left for five hours again. We heeded the water conservation advice and were very frugal with our water use. It didn't matter. The truck that came to deliver water gave us only part of a load and the leaking water pump wasted a healthy portion of what they did deliver. Then to make matters worse, we had to listen to the water conservation lecture a couple of more times when it had nothing to do with us. I don't believe we got our value from our money this time.

The deck views and beach in front were awesome.  Our family would definitely come back to this rental.  The only thing that didn't work was the computer, but the WIFI worked great.

See below for more information about the complex.  Courtyard 1 sleeps 2 people.  It has a queen size bed, private bath, heat, AC, ceiling fan, and access to a common sitting room.\n\nHacienda del Mar is a seven-unit hacienda style home situated in the gated community of Las Conchas. Rooms can be rented individually or in any combination to accommodate groups up to 15 people. Each room, or unit, has been given a name, and each has a painted ceramic \"name-tile\" mounted by the door to keep everyone oriented. They are El Pelicano, La Paloma, La Chuparosa, La Sala, Courtyard 1, Courtyard 2 and Aguila. Hacienda del Mar offers a quiet and private respite with easy access to the pristine beaches of the Sea of Cortez, only minutes away from the restaurants, shopping and nightlife of Puerto Pe√±asco, Mexico's newest emerging vacation destination. From the many porches are  panoramic views of both the northern Sonoran desert and the sea. Decor is that of a traditional Mexican hacienda, with shaded porches and walkways, patio and barbecue, and hand-carved stone fountain in the beautifully landscaped yard and garden. Guest rooms are non-smoking. Each of the seven rooms features a private tiled bath, queen beds with pillow-top mattresses for that restful night of shut-eye as the ocean surf murmurs in the background. The ceilings in the upper level rooms including La Paloma, La Chuparosa and La Sala are boveda (brick domes), handcrafted by an artisan from Guadalajara; they are absolutely stunning!  All accommodations have access to a common game room/sitting area with Satellite TV, DVD, a  large patio with gas grill and full kitchen, outside shower for swimmers,and ample parking. Innkeepers request No Smoking Inside and No Pets.

A couple of dead roaches in our room and kitchen. Screen doors don't open/shut properly, etc. The kitchen has NO ventilation whatsoever, not ideal to cook in. We were promised new linens and towels because we had paid for over over 3 days, they never arrived. We tried using the washer/dryer, but, they aren't really working properly. We were promised complimentary coffee on the first day, it only arrived on the third day. The coffee maker hardly works, takes forever and you have to keep pressing the start button over and over again to keep it brewing. The front doors to the main shared room and our room DO NOT LOCK, these are easily accessible to anyone off the street. And while I was assured that \"nothing has ever happened\" at this site; it was not comforting at all to know there was such a lax security situation. My only comfort was that I wasn't traveling alone. Otherwise, I would not have felt very safe. The pros are the location, it is quiet and peaceful there, complimentary breakfast pastries were provided, it is very economical..but you do get what you pay for. The Oceano employees are professional, friendly and nice. I just don't think this particular rental is up to snuff though. It probably was once, a very lovely and charming place. But, with so many rentals available in Rocky Point, one has plenty of options that are more modern, secure and economical."},{"title":"nice place","city":"Mesa","state":"AZ","comment":"Nice location near the beach safe but the air-condition sometimes not working "},{"title":"Good place to stay","city":"Fullerton","state":"CA","comment":"Booked this place as a last minute vacation plan.

The condo met our expectations, but we had just a couple of issues. This property is listed to accommodate 8 people. We brought 8 down, but with the second bedroom having two full sized beds, we did not quite fit. We ended up with one sleeping on the floor. That being said, I'd rather be allowed to bring 8 and have one on the floor than have to pay extra for the 8th person. One other small issue was that the sliding glass door was very difficult to open. Besides that, you can't beat Playa Encanto in October!

The beach for this location is the best beach I have ever stayed at in Rocky Point.  It was beautiful, quiet and very clean.  It is 20-25 minutes away from town but that wasn't so bad.  When we first arrived at the town home it seemed fine but once it was time to relax on the couches and then go to bed it was gross.  One of the couches smelled like urine and the sheets to two of the beds were disgusting.  The sheets to one bed had blood stains and the other was filled with beach sand.  We complained to the workers on site and all they said was, \"yeah, it's common for the sheets to be dirty.\" We asked for new sheets but they said they couldn't do anything about it and it pretty much wasn't their problem.  I continued complaining and finally someone opened a locked door to a room in the house, which had a washer and dryer.  They weren't happy they had to do it but I was able to wash the sheets.  My last complaint about the home is the back door. It locked on its own and locked us out.  We had to wait for two hours before someone arrived with a spare. I explained to the man with the spare key the situation and he said that happened a lot. It's so unfortunate because I loved this beach so much but with staff who are aware of the issues to a home they're supposed to be taking care of and brush them off as if there isn't a problem really made what was supposed to be a relaxing mini vacation, to a stressful one."},{"title":"4 days of paradise","city":"Peyton","state":"Colorado","comment":"We had a wonderful time, the condo was perfect for the 4 of us.

The condo was the perfect size for a family of four.  At first, it was a little difficult to find because the name of the condos wasn't clear on the buildings.  Our grill was missing the rack and we called the rental company and they brought over a grill to use.  The dishes were well stocked. The waves were calm and peaceful the first few days but then got a little choppy.  I think there was a storm coming in.  There were only a few people going by selling items.  Bring towels, board games, and favorite pantry staples that you love.  You won't find your usual wares at the store.  It would have been helpful if the rental pointed out where the grocery stores and restaurants were.

Aside from that disappointment, being moved to this property was very pleasant. It was clean, comfortable and had very pleasant neighbors staying next to us. I would definitely stay here again. The only minor issues was an occasional smell from the bathroom most likely due to the dated sewage system in the Las Conchas area and a fridge with a compressor that was pretty loud.

Though it was wet \u0026#38; chilly during our stay, we had an absolute blast.  603 was a cute \u0026#38; quaint \u0026#38; cozy townhome, and just the right size for all of us.  Kitchen was fully equipped to cook anything that we brought or purchased at Ley.  Bring a lighter though, you need to light underneath the oven in order for it to work.  The dining area was nice too, but the little area between the dining area and the master bedroom needs some maintenance on the drain as it was raining and the water continue to collect in there and was pretty noisy at one point.  The master bedroom had a nice sized closet with a dresser in it so we didn't have to live out of our suitecases, but the closet wouldnt' open all the way.  The master bathroom had a nice sized shower, but we nearly had cold showers every day, and when the water would warm up, it was a chilly luke warm.  Not much counter space, but thankfully I have a hanging storage case I travel with so we survived :-) Loved the location so close to the beach.  My son \u0026#38; boyfriend had a blast running and jumping off the edge of the property down to the beach too.  It was nice sitting on the porch and in the living room with the patio door open listening to the ocean waves.  I would stay at 603 again as long as the few minor things were addressed and repaired/fixed.

This was our third time staying here and have some observations. We had to scour the house to find enough towels for the four of us who stayed there. Only one kitchen towel and wash cloth came in the kitchen. The pots and pans that are available are both old and gross. The knives were so dull it was hard to cut anything and wondered where the closest urgent care was. It was painful drinking wine out of plastic glasses. I believe that such an outstanding property should have updated kitchen ware.

This was my first time renting. The house was in great shape and very beautiful. I did come down with little kids and we had to move several decorations to avoid anything being broken. But being beach front made a world of difference. It was amazing! I loved sitting on the porch at night watching the sunset or first thing in the morning watching the Dolphins swim by. This house made the vacation. I would strongly suggest renting this house for anyone and will definitely rent the house again.

One of my favorite things about it was the beautiful tile work throughout.  My extended family of 7 adults and 2 small children enjoyed the room the house had to offer.  With every family having their own room and bath, we were able to enjoy privacy when wanted.  The family room and kitchen were set in a great room that allowed us to gather for cooking, eating and conversation.  The patio with fire pit was\u003cbr/\u003eextensively used, even more than the interior during the day.  Evenings spent by the fire and star gazing were highlights of our visit.  In addition, there was plenty of beach gear, umbrellas, chairs, etc.  Access to the beach was just a few steps away.  The house was clean and well maintained.

However the second time the dishwasher was not working which was one of the amenities we wanted as we cook a lot. I'm not sure why Oceano doesn't have a punch list to check all appliances before each rental. Based on the issue with the dishwasher it most likely needs the mother board replaced or the entire unit.  Since we thought it would take some time to repair we didn't call Oceano.  However when the owner's daughter, showed up at the house on Thusday (we were to depart on Friday)saying she thought she had rented it for the week-end we told her about the dishwasher.  Instead of leaving and going to Oceano to see what the mix up was she stayed at the house, used the phone and took some air mattress out of the closet. Our thought's were once she realized the house was occupied she should have left.  Very uncomfortable for us.  The owner, a gentleman, actually called us when we arrived and was very gracious and asked if we needed anything.  We weren't aware at that time that the dishwasher wasn't working but were very pleased he called.  Maybe he needs to suggest to his daughter not disturb tenants while the house is occupied.  Overall good experience and we will rent this house again."},{"title":"BELLA MAREAS RENTAL","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"ONE OF THE NICEST HOMES THAT I HAVE EVER  VACATIONED IN ROCKY POINT.

On arrival in the late afternoon, the heat was not working in our rental and the condo for my parents was in the process of being cleaned. Fortunately a maintenance man was at the property and tried to fix the heat.  Unfortunately the repair wasn't fixed and at 10pm we called Oceano. They sent the same man over and it was decided that he couldn't repair our heat at that time so we repacked all our things and moved to a beautiful house with zoned heating.  Unfortunately, the heat was working in one half of the unit and not the other half. My son got a good sleep, but the rest of the family didn't.  It was 53F in our side of house! Also the oven didn't work and part of the house had a sewer smell. We called the next morning \u003cbr/\u003eand they said that we should move back to the original condo.  The heat was repaired at that unit. We did and we had a good stay there for the rest of our vacation.

I contacted Oceano and they replaced the refrigerator."},{"title":"Love Rocky Point","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"Very nice Condo on the beach.

The arcadia door was smooth to open and close only problem it would slam and sound like glass was going too break at any moment.Once we learned to control the slider not too much of a problem after that.House was clean but just a little too much in way of furniture that got in the way.Overall it was comfortable."},{"title":"Rocky point trip","city":"Mesa","state":"AZ","comment":"Had so much fun.

We spent 7 nights there. While the home was pretty clean, we were disappointed in the condition of the majority of the leather chairs (torn - I have pictures if you'd like to see) and the broken chimenea.  We had brought wood with us so we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful seaside and sunsets, to no avail. One burner on the stove didn't work and the kitchen was very disorganized as though no had cared where things were put away.  We had to request light bulbs twice, but we were finally able to replace the burned out bulbs in the living room and hall. Seating for 6 was a bit inadequate in the \"living room,\" but the weather was nice enough we spent much time outside during the day and sat around the dining table playing card games at night.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWith all that said (for owner's information), we look forward to going back.

As we entered, the fridge was taken apart and located in the dining/living room.  It also did not look like the house was as clean as it could be.  We went back to the rental office and the staff there was at no help to us, they did not even get out of their seats to address us.  After lots of arguing they sent over a maintenance man to address the fridge situation.  The maids were also there as they said they did not finish cleaning.  The staff imformed us they could not change condos because our 3 nights of rent was already promissed to the owners and they couldn't switch us with another guest who was only staying 2 nights.  That is not the guests concern, it's the management company's.  While we did end up enjoying our stay, we weren't impressed with the Oceano office Staff.  I would recommend to the owners of the property that they switch management companies.

The house was clean.  We love the new refrigerator, it is very spacious. We love that you got rid of the small one in the bar area and added the beer drop in. Cable is way too confusing, couldn't get the TV's working to be able to watch cable. The house could use a new paint job. Would love if you had some ant spray left under each sink as they were in the bathrooms and kitchen. We loved the new decor since our last visit, much more modern.

"},{"title":"Magical Weekend at the Beachcomber","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"This is the 2nd time we've stayed at the Beachcomber in the beautiful Las Conchas community and both times can only be described as magical.  The home is older but is quite large and has been nicely updated.  It just has this warm, homey, mexico-feel to it. The Wi-Fi didn't work which was a little disappointing but we survived without it. The best part in my opinion is the gorgeous, large patio just feet from the ocean.  We witnessed the most fantastic sunrises and sunsets from it, barbequed and ate there, and watched the ocean turn from dark gray, to green to varying shades of turquoise with the changes in sunlight and weather conditions.  The last day we were there it was quite windy which caused the sea to churn wildly (love it when it looks like that).  In doing so, it stirred up and deposited this beautiful sea foam that lined the shore and we watched as the wind tore chunks of the seafoam away from the larger pieces and blew the fluffy seafoam \"snow balls\" all over the beach.  Never saw that before. Just beautiful.  "},{"title":"Beachcomber blast!","city":"","state":"","comment":"We very much enjoyed our experience at Beachcomber. It is probably the best home we've stayed in at Rocky Point. Right away, we decided this would be our permanent rental home. We had only 2 disappointments: the showers are the worst we've experienced as far as pressure goes; and the beach was the rockiest we've experienced to the point that it's dangerous to go in the water if it's not high tide.  Overall, very satisfied."},{"title":"BEAUTIFUL HOUSE","city":"Mesa","state":"AZ","comment":"Everything was great, except the water pressure from the showers on all bathrooms was not very good.

The only bummer about the place is the beach is really rocky, just a mile down Las Conchas the beach is really sandy and much nicer."},{"title":"Great quick trip","city":"Chandler","state":"AZ","comment":"We only had time to come down for a day trip to Las Conchas, and Oceano was extremely accommodating.   Beachcomber is a huge rental that easily handled our two small families (4 adults and 2 small children).  The view was amazing, especially at sunset.  The deck above the patio was awesome for viewing the stars."},{"title":"Nice patio, Weird House","city":"Mesa","state":"AZ","comment":"The patio was nice but the house has a lot of problems. The hot water took 15 minutes to get warm, if ever. The master shower second head just dribbled water. The charcoal BBQ grill was just a rusted out old gas grill. The fireplaces were non-functional. The kitchen is completely separate from the main living area. Garage access does not come with house rental. The beach at this part of Las Conchas has rocky sand as compared to further into Las Conchas. There is essentially no view from any bedroom. Only the master bedroom has an en suite. Unpainted patches on the wall are present. The furniture has ugly water stains on it. "},{"title":"Great Rental","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"House is a bit dated, but fine overall.

Owner requests No Smoking Inside, Pets Allowed with Extra Security Deposit. Sheets, one set of bath towels and drinking water are provided. 2-night Minimum during the week; 3-night minimum during weekends in March, April, May, and October and all Holidays.\n\n   Message from Casa  Zillori owner: As the owners of Casa Zillori, we welcome you and hope that you have a wonderful holiday on the beautiful Sea of Cortez. For over 20 years we have enjoyed the peace and beauty of this place, the spellbinding sunsets and the charm of the city. As frequent visitors to Puerto Penasco, it became impossible for us to ignore the plight of many of the street dogs suffering from illness, starvation and sometimes outright cruelty. On several occasions we took abandoned, sick and starving dogs back to the United States to be rehabilitated and to find loving \"forever\" homes.\n A few years ago we encountered Barb Mumbach, who operates Barb's Dog Rescue about five miles north of town. She is an incredible woman who has struggled to help these poor dogs in any way that she can . She cares for them at her rescue providing food, medicine, and lots of love. She has also arranged for spaying and neutering, as well as many successful adoptions to the United States.\n  Your choice to stay at Casa Zillori is a significant benefit to these dogs because we have pledge 100% of all rental revenues from Casa Zillori to Barb's Dog Rescue.\nI hope you have a chance to stop by and visit Barb, and even consider a contribution toward her wonderful efforts.\n  To the world, Barb is a dog rescuer. To each of these needy dogs, she is their world."},{"title":"Driving Directions","description":null},{"title":"Room Description","description":"Both bedrooms are master suites, each with king size beds, an ocean view, and private bathrooms with showers."}]},"name":"Casa Zillori","num_floors":1,"occupancy":4,"position":{"latitude":31.285229,"longitude":-113.470295},"type":"house","reviews":[{"title":"Casa Zillori","city":"Fountain Hills","state":"AZ","comment":"older but well maintained and very well equipped including wifi"},{"title":"Zillori","city":"Fruitland","state":"ID","comment":"The property needs a lot of updating.

We never turned on the TV, but it is small and very old."},{"title":"Casita de Carolina","city":"Pnoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"The typical little issues- faulty lamps, no spare lightbulbs, no broom/dustpan, broken outdoor furniture.

Los tocayos is absolutely beautiful! The pictures that are shown do not do it any justice at all. The third bedroom isn't shown in the pic's provided, but it is really spacious and has an a joined bathroom with tons of storage space. There isn't a photo of the kitchen and because of that, I thought I would be disappointed, but boy was I wrong! The kitchen is really nice with tons of counter space and its equipped with everything to preparing a small meal or if you're cooking for a large family. There is also a corner office space that's at the front entrance that's really cozy and secluded from the rest of the house. I really appreciated the little attributes that the property offered as well. Like the fireplace, the ability to dim the lights, and also the little lit cutouts in the walls displaying beautiful multi-colored glass vases. I found those little accents peaceful and romantic.  The grounds are beautiful despite the shabbiness. I appreciated it though because feel as though it gave the property a more natural tropical feel. Another attribute that the property do not mention in the description is that it has a rooftop overlook of the ocean that is breathtaking. The only negative is that the property do not offer wifi but there is phone service. This rental is great for large families with children or multiple families, it has tons of open space. I will definitely be visiting Los tocayos again... I really appreciated its modernness unlike most of the other rentals. I will also like to thank the staff of oceano rentals that helped us through it all, they were very friendly, professional and pleasant.\u003cbr/\u003eThe Santana Family \u003cbr/\u003ePhoenix, AZ "},{"title":"Trip was great however","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","comment":"The house rented was beautiful, but not at all prepared for our stay.  To begin, we had no water upon arrival.  When we did get water, zero water pressure.  The shower stopped on my son midshower.  The gas grill had no knobs, the oven door was locked-which my children wanted to use to make me a birthday cake.  The house had a horrible odor the seemed to come in off and on.  Not sure if there was something wrong with the A/C. ?? We had to call for assistance for all these things.  We also had to ask for the cable box for the master bedroom.  The home was beautiful but not at all prepared.  Lots of issues.  Do not think I would rent the same home."},{"title":"Fun for the Fourh!

The house offers a great lay out and a very nice kitchen that was fully stocked. The decor is not really Mexican or rustic, but we spent little time inside! Ac worked great and ceiling fans were a plus! We already booked the house again for another weekend!

Guest rooms are non-smoking. Each of the seven rooms features a private tiled bath, queen beds with pillow-top mattresses for that restful night of shut-eye as the ocean surf murmurs in the background.

There are regular tiled stairs outside leading up to the deck.  Well-equipped kitchen.  The water pressure to the upstairs bathroom sink is low.  We didn't try the upstairs shower, but the toilets both had plenty of pressure.  We were able to park in the garage, and the gates to the yard both functioned nicely.

It needs updated bedding, furniture, and fixtures badly. The site description said the upper level had a sleeper sofa, but the actual sofa in the property is not a sleeper. It was falsely advertised. The house was very dirty. It had not been swept, there was dust everywhere, and the sheets were dirty. And there are roaches in the kitchen and the bathroom. The fan in the master bedroom also did not work. The spiral stairs did not feel safe. Positives: Great beach access, great ocean view, safe quiet neighborhood, easy access from the community guard house, good pots and pans in the kitchen. This place just needs some work. Renting was quick and easy, all transaction papers were sent via email. Directions to Rocky Point office were accurate and clear."},{"title":"A so so place","city":"Chandler","state":"AZ","comment":"The pictures of the home are dated. When we got there, there was no water on the second floor. Oceana was prompt in having it fixed. The property says it has a DVD player, radio, and HD flat screen TV. No radio, the TV was a small Panasonic, the DVD wasn't hooked to it, and the operating instructions are for a Visio flat screen. It was also in the area of beach, which is all rock. we drove to better beaches. Other than these issues, the house was comfortable.

It literally was hot the whole night and it did not cool down until more half way into our next day. That alone was terrible for our stay. Then, there was a nice breakfast promised from our booking. We walked into the old,dirty common room in the morning. There were cobwebs on the doors to get in and even some inside. We feltlike wewere in a horror film at times because of hire quiet and lonely and dirty the area felt. We looked around for our breakfast and there was nothing. I called the main office and they told me our breakfast was inside the refrigerator. He said it was not something to get excited about; he told me to look for a tray with a milk carton, rice pudding, and I'm not sure what else. That alone did not sound appetizing. So we didn't eat breakfast either morning of our two night stay. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePositive:secluded area, great security, really close to the beach. Aside from this, definitely not much else left to be desired. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOverall, I will never stay here again.

It is very close to the beach, which was important-I had been looking for beachfront, but this worked perfectly. We had a couple snafus, but a phone call to the management had someone at our door in 15 minutes to correct it. The kitchen is well stocked for big gatherings.

Beautiful house right on the water, water crashes up against your break wall.  When we first arrived, two of the rooms A/C did not work, come to find out they are controlled with two double AA batteries, which were missing.  A 20 minute ride back to Oceano to report this was required.  Other issues, no towels in bathrooms, no daily maid service as advertised, house had several areas of disrepair, (tile, paint, concrete, outdoor grill could not be used, it was rusted beyond use, we did find a nice one in garage that was used for our cooking.  Kitchen supplies was not typical of an Oceano rental, especially $880 / night.  Nice place though, on a beautiful beach with no rocks.  If one was to stay there, have to be a little patient and make sure the above mentioned items are in place and service is provided as advertised.

Thank you Oceano Rentals, Rocky Point!!","city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","comment":"We rented Casa Espiritu from Oceano Rentals in Rocky Point for 4 days for the July 4th holiday. The location of the house was unbelievable! It was right on the beach with the waves hitting the walls of the house in the afternoon hours and the water receding in the morning hours to give us ample sandy beaches to walk on! AMAZING experience \u0026#38; BEAUTIFUL views!! The house itself was very spacious, with 8 BIG bedrooms with attached bathrooms + a powder room, a huge living area and a nice sized kitchen. \u003cbr/\u003eWe received outstanding customer service from everyone at Oceano Rentals but especially from Omar - even on the weekend!

Oceano put it right and had a new grill out to the house within a couple of hours. Couple of gripes the sliding doors in the house are almost not functional and had to be forced open and closed and I mean forced, two grown adult men needed,the other gripe is the AC in the guest house is non functional, fortunately the weather was cool at night. Also I feel that the house is miss repented on line, it is actually 3 different houses or units, there is the guest house, there is the main house, and there is a two bedroom apartment upstairs, which is only accessible from outside the main residence. Overall a nice house but is really needing some maintenance done. Oh yeah the grill grave yard on the side of the house is a classy touch. As always you go to Rocky Point for the beach not the house and the house was perfect for our size group, just needs some tlc I do expect a little better for the 1k a day price tag."},{"title":"What Could Have Been a Great Vacation ","city":"Las Cruces","state":"NM","comment":" The location was ideal, but unfortunately the home itself was in terrible condition to say the least.

I do have some issues to report. 1) When we first arrived to check in, we were told that they were having issues with the water and there might be a chance we ran out. As soon as we got to the rental, we saw the front outside water spout  just runningwide open. This seemed very irresponsible, especially since we were told we might run out of water. 2) To my surprise, there were a couple of bags that were left by housekeeping with cleaning supplies all over the master  bedroom. This was quite frustrating since Oceano Rentals were VERY particular with how we left the property. For example, not leaving any trash in any of the trash cans before leaving the property or we can be charged. 3) I also was not happy to see that yes we did have a television that was very outdated, but the worse part was we couldn't even use it. There was no antenna or cable so we had nothing to watch. Oceano Rentals did provide us with a couple VHS movies, but no VHS player. There was no entertainment and I think they could provide at least a radio or a television that actually works. 4) I also found it very frustrating to have a rental that occupies six guests and only one key. It can be really frustrating especially when planning to go out an explore Puerto Penasco and having to plan to come back at the same time as other guests to enter the property. 5) Lastly, when we went to drop off the key, we had arrived before the office was opened. We had to come back at 9am and the office did not open on time. We were told by an employee waiting outside, that an unmarked box was the drop off for the key. We were never told about this box when checking in and were extremely frustrated since we wanted to head home and were waiting to return the key. Customer service was very difficult to deal with. We had to call multiple times and wait hours on end for basic amenities, such as toilet paper and clean bath towels."},{"title":"Vacation in Paradise","city":"Gilbert","state":"Arizona","comment":"Delphin Verde is in a perfect location to enjoy the tranquility of the Sea of Cortez.  You wake up to the awesome sight of the sea and birds.  It is in close proximity to all that Rocky Point has to offer...food, shopping, boat trips... Delphin Verde is close to The Malecon in which there is shopping, Great Food (The Satisfied Frog, Sr. Amigo's, Mary's Seafood, Thunder on the Beach, Bacanora Grill and so many more). Delphin Verde is a clean, quiet, well stocked vacation rental. Pack your clothes and head on down. Delphin Verde what a view to wake up to and hold in your memories. It was such a joy to work with the staff.  They were professional in every aspect: easy to talk with, they answered everyone of my emails, and so easy to work with when down in Rocky Point.  The property was so clean and well maintained.  I would recommend this place to everyone.

","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"We rented Aventura for a guys weekend, so needless to say we didn't need anything luxurious. The Condo itself was in OK condition, and at first seemed clean.  When I tried to go out the sliding door the handle literally came off the door, so it was not secured. Our second night someone broke in to our condo and stole items and money. They got in through the affixed part of the security door by pushing it open. That same morning we noticed dead roscoes in the shower.  When we brought this up to the Oceano office at check out they seemed unable to rectify anything since it was the Condo's owner responsibility.

We had kitchen cabinet doors falling off.  The kitchen was also not adequately stocked.  We did not have a dish cloth to wash dishes, and no sponge or scrubbing pads.  There were only 3 coffee cups.  We requested additional cups, and they were never brought.  In the past we have always had a broom and adequate trashbags.  We only had 3 trash bags and no broom to clean up with.

Separate and private bedroom/guest house for the newlyweds and good space for the 6 of us in the main house. Clean, safe and good location in Rocky Point. It was great having the beach right outside our patio. I wanted a broom and dustpan to periodically sweep out the sand, so I bought one at the store and left it there. Hopefully it will stay, but take your own just in case you want to sweep up. Appreciated the use of the garage to store cars. Trash was a bit of an issue. We weren't sure where to dispose so left it outside next to the garage. Would have been good to know. Great place!

The employees also sent two handymen to try to rectify the fact that the TV satellite was not operable. Unfortunately, after a whole afternoon of troubleshooting, the TV satellite issue was never resolved nor was there any follow-up from the office. I would've liked to be credited for the fact we did not have a working satellite TV available to us for our three-night stay.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe interior of the home is clean and beds were comfortable.  We had plenty of hot water for showers.  The linens were clean. We were provided with a bar of soap in each bathroom and dishwashing detergent. The A/C and Internet connection are strong amenities. Our main gripe was the fact that the glass door that leads to the beach is so damaged that you must struggle with the door to open and close EVERY time you want to step outside and take in the breeze/view. At times, it seemed like the door was going to fall off and break onto the floor. The breeze was quite strong and due to the condition of the glass doors, one could hear the strong breeze howling through the door all night/day long. There is a tiny courtyard between the main house and the garage, which is nice when you need to leave a few things out to dry in the sun. Also, serves as a mini yard. This property is good if you want to steer clear from the craziness at Sandy Beach but I do not think it was worth the price. I was charged over $600 and we were constantly worried about breaking the glass door and had no TV, as indicated. I would've appreciated a refund for the fact that the TV issue was never resolved.\u003cbr/\u003e"},{"title":"our stay","city":"COTTONWOOD","state":"AZ","comment":"did not start out good, first place we had booked should not be a rental.

We were very displeased by Cupula Azul. In general the house is run down and not maintained well at all. I would expect a larger home (4 bedrooms) that sleeps as many people as Cupula Azul does, to have a fully functioning kitchen. This unfortunately was not the case. Only two of the burners on the stove worked, the rusted out refrigerator had broken shelves that we had to try and prop up to hold our food. The gas grill pictured does not work, there is a charcoal grill next to it to use. All of this combined made it difficult for us to enjoy large meals that we typically cook with our big group. The beds and couches were also very hard and uncomfortable. If the owner is going to continue to use this as a rental property, they desperately need to put some money into the house. We will not be renting this house again and would not recommend it to anyone.

We have rented numerous homes in Rocky Point and always have a great time.  We thought it was sad that the property had not been maintained at the same level as the other homes in the area.  It was still a great three days at the beach.  Fresh paint, refinished flooring and newer linens would make all the difference in the world."},{"title":"tired","city":"Tulsa","state":"OK","comment":"total beds still have original covers from thirty years ago,paint from same time,windows have failed and are cloudy,do not have enough time to start on kitchen"},{"title":"Good view for the price","city":"Tolleson","state":"AZ","comment":"Sheets and covers from the beds seemed clean, a bit outdated but that was fine. The fridge was disgusting, seemed like the outside had rotten stains, we didnt even want to buy any food to put in there. The view from the back patio was nice as we could see the beach and the kids could walk up to it. Although the outside shower did not work so the kids would walk in the house all full of sand. Another thing, they had one tv in the living room but we didnt get to watch it because it had no cable nor dvd player, just vcr, so the kids were a bit bored when they werent in the water. The furniture was a bit outdated, but again, for the price it was fine.

Our only issue was with the lack of cleanliness/updates. The floors need to be redone as the tile is peeling, everything inside (windows too) were dusty, the fridge had splatters on it and is missing drawers and shelves, the dishwasher didn't work, the oven smelled like fish, there were no curtain hung in the living room, allowing anyone to see in. We found curtains but there were no rings to hang them so we just had to drape them over the rod. IT also would have been nice to know we needed propane to grill - we ended up grilling at the neighbors! Overall slightly disappointed and would look to book our other favorite house in the future that happened to be booked this weekend."},{"title":"Cupula Azul","city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","comment":"Won't stay there again. We felt like what we received was not what was advertised. Stayed with GoOceano in the past with good results-just not this time. I told them about this, but they said they would tell the owner and see what happens. When we arrived, the property had 2 cabinet doors ripped off the hinges, the Saltillo tile floor was flaking up everywhere from peeling sealant, nasty chemical (bug spray?) smell that never went away, multiple water leak locations with unrepaired drywall and drooping paint from the ceiling, exposed electrical, loose, moldy plumbing fixtures in bath/kitchen, and the property was in general disrepair (we have photos). We understand this is Mexico, but this place was just bad, and not worth the asking price. Between our party we own 30+ rentals in Phoenix so we understand that some things can fall through the cracks, but this is not acceptable."},{"title":"Lovely Vacation","city":"Oro Valley","state":"AZ","comment":"We really enjoyed staying in this house. It has the perfect floor plan. Open central living and dining area with large windows to see the ocean and a truly stellar porch. Nicely functioning fireplace. Lots of sleeping space. Plenty of dishes and kitchen supplies. Nice bathrooms. The decor is subtle and tasteful.The negatives were minor. Those of us who go to Rocky Point a lot expect some funkiness and deferred maintenance. The frig (which is being replaced) is missing shelves, but it has a back up 2nd small frig. The floors are due to be refinished, but that didn't bother us at all (just cosmetic). The beds in the master and 2nd bedroom are very hard, but the bunk beds were nice. Sheets and towels were plentiful and good quality. The window in the master bedroom is clouded over, but we are told it is being replaced. We couldn't get the outdoor grill to work, but Oceano warned us that it was troublesome and when we asked them to bring us a charcoal grill they did so within 15 minutes! Kudos! The only thing that might be a bothersome is the  bug spray smell.  It is only bad when the heat is on. We were fine with no heat (even during Christmas), so it was not an issue. They had to treat the house for termites, so perhaps the smell will wear off.  If you are sensitive, ask to have the heat kept off and bring/buy firewood for the fireplace. I really want to endorse Oceano Rentals- they are very courteous, friendly and professional."},{"title":"2014 Rally","city":"Peoria","state":"AZ","comment":"The house is nice but we had no satelite tv or wireless Internet "},{"title":"Birthday celebration","city":"Avondale","state":"Az","comment":"The house was beachfront with a huge patio, it was very enjoyable.

Tile is worn out, furnishings poor and wore out, appliances rusted and poor.  Kitchen sink was leaking and broken, grill broken and have to have both replaced from Oceano.  Ceiling has signs of leaks and paint falling pealing in several rooms.  Would not recommend this to anyone, check you tube for real info, as Oceano did not represent well.  If I was Oceano I would drop this property.  We expressed our concern and they did repair the sink and brought a used grill, but other than that it was like ohhhh well.  Very poor considering I recommend them all the time.

The gentleman in the office was helpful and considerate.  However, the house was in horrible condition and did not reflect our past house rentals with Oceana.  The owners have allowed the house to decay considerably.  I would not recommend that Oceana continue to keep this house in its inventory.  The bed are rock hard.  The sheets are threadbare.  Pillows had no cushion.  Tile throughout the house cracked or missing.  Screens on windows missing.  Outside shower rusted out and not working.  Outside grill not working.  Dishwasher not working.

"},{"title":"This Place is a DUMP!","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"It was my distinct displeasure to rent this house for four days in May of 2015.  The beds had bed bugs, or dust mites that ate us all to pieces.  Speaking of the beds, they were horribly uncomfortable - either too soft, or too hard.  In addition, the pull-out bed in the family room was ridiculous, the cushions were so sunken into the couch we couldn't even open the bed.  There were dead bugs in the kitchen cabinets, and live ants marching in the dining room.  Half of the windows didn't have screens, so we were inviting all sorts of flying objects into the house all hours of the day and night.  It's hard to believe they are charging $50.00 as a cleaning fee, in truth this place hasn't REALLY been cleaned in years.  Plaster and paint were chipping off the walls and ceilings, and the floors were in need of repair and grout.  Overall, this was a most unsatisfactory experience.

Description","description":"Hacienda del Mar is a seven-unit hacienda style home situated in the gated community of Las Conchas. Rooms can be rented individually or in any combination to accommodate groups up to 15 people. Each room, or unit, has been given a name, and each has a painted ceramic \"name-tile\" mounted by the door to keep everyone oriented. They are El Pelicano, La Paloma, La Chuparosa, La Sala, Courtyard 1, Courtyard 2 and Aguila. Hacienda del Mar offers a quiet and private respite with easy access to the pristine beaches of the Sea of Cortez, only minutes away from the restaurants, shopping and nightlife of Puerto Pe√±asco, Mexico's newest emerging vacation destination. From the many porches are  panoramic views of both the northern Sonoran desert and the sea. Decor is that of a traditional Mexican hacienda, with shaded porches and walkways, patio and barbecue, and hand-carved stone fountain in the beautifully landscaped yard and garden. Guest rooms are non-smoking. Each of the seven rooms features a private tiled bath, queen beds with pillow-top mattresses for that restful night of shut-eye as the ocean surf murmurs in the background. The ceilings in the upper level rooms including La Paloma, La Chuparosa and La Sala are boveda (brick domes), handcrafted by an artisan from Guadalajara; they are absolutely stunning!  All accommodations have access to a common game room/sitting area with Satellite TV, DVD, a  large patio with gas grill and full kitchen, outside shower for swimmers,and ample parking. Innkeepers request No Smoking Inside and No Pets. Children under the age of 2 stay free."},{"title":"Driving Directions","description":"Take a left at first light, onto Blvd. Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez, when entering Rocky Point.

Description","description":"La Chuparosa is a room located at Hacienda del Mar.  See below for more information about the complex.  La Chuparosa sleeps 2 people and is beautifully designed with boveda ceilings and fireplace. It has a queen size bed, private bath, heat, AC, ceiling fan, and outside veranda sitting area.\n\nHacienda del Mar is a seven-unit hacienda style home situated in the gated community of Las Conchas. Rooms can be rented individually or in any combination to accommodate groups up to 15 people. Each room, or unit, has been given a name, and each has a painted ceramic \"name-tile\" mounted by the door to keep everyone oriented. They are El Pelicano, La Paloma, La Chuparosa, La Sala, Courtyard 1, Courtyard 2 and Aguila. Hacienda del Mar offers a quiet and private respite with easy access to the pristine beaches of the Sea of Cortez, only minutes away from the restaurants, shopping and nightlife of Puerto Pe√±asco, Mexico's newest emerging vacation destination. From the many porches are  panoramic views of both the northern Sonoran desert and the sea. Decor is that of a traditional Mexican hacienda, with shaded porches and walkways, patio and barbecue, and hand-carved stone fountain in the beautifully landscaped yard and garden. Guest rooms are non-smoking. Each of the seven rooms features a private tiled bath, queen beds with pillow-top mattresses for that restful night of shut-eye as the ocean surf murmurs in the background. The ceilings in the upper level rooms including La Paloma, La Chuparosa and La Sala are boveda (brick domes), handcrafted by an artisan from Guadalajara; they are absolutely stunning!  All accommodations have access to a common game room/sitting area with Satellite TV, DVD, a  large patio with gas grill and full kitchen, outside shower for swimmers,and ample parking. Innkeepers request No Smoking Inside and No Pets.

I arrived late on Friday to find a room that was not up to standards in cleaningness, the floors and bathroom were dirty. The shower had little to no water pressure and to my surprise the next day, no hot water. I called the emergency number twice on Saturday morning from the informational guide only to find out I had to wait over an hour to have someone come down and check the problem out. I had an appointment that morning and had no other option but to shower with cold water and the little water pressure there was. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe maintenance person stated the property was completely out of gas and there was no fix to the shower or the water pressure. He made a call and the executive decision to move me and the next door guest to another room as they too had the same issues. I was moved to La Sala.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLa Sala was dirty, had no clean towels or extra pillows/covers, it had stained towels and also no hot water or water pressure. It took the same amount of time to have someone from maintenance come down and confirm the water was turned off and the gas wasn‚Äôt properly installed the day before. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eI have lots of concerns and I'm sure that if you were the guest you would have the same concerns and frustrations.

So beautiful and great location! And the owner is the sweetest lady ever!"},{"title":"Disappointment with Hacienda del Mar","city":"Mesa","state":"AZ","comment":"This a beautifully decorated home less than two blocks from an entrance to the beach.The beach was just OK. It was hot and the air conditioner was not cooling very well and should be replaced. The wall around the air conditioner has gaps, it needs to be sealed.  The shower and sink water pressure was extremely  low so it took forever to wash and rinse. There was a rain storm and the ceiling and wall leaked about 2 inches on the floor. We asked for towels and mopped it up ourselves. Unfortunately,the ceiling leaked on my tablet and it no longer works. The owner simply said it wasn't covered by her insurance - having owned and rented properties before, that is not an acceptable response. The breakfast was continental and nothing to rave about.  All in all, we will never stay here again. It really was not an enjoyable stay and the loss of my tablet made it worse.  I still think management should contribute towards the repair (if that is possible) or its replacement.  Next time, we plan to go back to Sonora Spa where we will be right on the beach, have beautiful pools and a beautiful condo that doesn't leak.  It may be double the price, but it is well worth it. This is far from the romantic B\u0026#38;B weekend I was hoping for. I would not recommend it to anyone.

We had to wait for 30 minutes before it was ready for the new guests.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSecond, the garage door was not working properly, so my car was never truly safe. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThird, there was no hot water in any of the 3 showers that are inside the property.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFourth, the neighborhood is not safe. Someone broke into the property while we were all in the beach and stole my purse, which contained my MacBook Air, U.S. and Mexico passports, driver's license, credit and debit cards, $200 dollars in cash, my purse, and even clothes. This happened in the middle of the day and I just feel this would not have happened if the garage door had been working properly. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eI filed a police report and even got an official document stating what had happened, but when I went to Oceano Rentals to discuss the issue, the staff member that spoke with me said he was going to bring the issue to the manager and the owner of the property, who is an American individual, but I never heard back from them. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAs much as I love driving down to Rocky Point, I will never stay in this area ever again and probably will not return to the town. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAlso, I wish the staff at Oceano Rentals would have been more proactive when I approached them for help. They should seriously consider hiring private security that makes sure the place is safe at all times. "},{"title":"Great Time!","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"Very nice and clean.

It felt safe especially because it had a garage. But the house itself needs a lot of improvements. For example; the fridge has an internal leak which dripped water all over our food (we ended up keeping the food on the fridge door), the AC drips water right by the stairs (dangerous!), the kids closet rod was down, the closet space on top was super filthy (don't dare look, ewww!)the sliding door doesn't slide as easily, the fan in the living room doesn't work and don't expect to see the microwave or t.v. pictured on the website(they should really update this). Oh and the music thumps all night long til about 4 am. We didn't care though, but if you want quiet nights then don't come to this beach. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNow for the pros: the AC worked amazing, towels and linens were plenty, the beach is just right there!, and we had no problem with water running out \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOverall we were satisfied mostly because we were only there in the mornings and evenings. I wouldn't go back to this particular rental (maybe I'll rent the next door neighbors house because of the location)"},{"title":"Great Location Not so good Condo","city":"Glendale","state":"Arizona","comment":"Mediocre at best!! Oceano room service couldn't get my condo ready until 9 o'clock at NIGHT! Wife and a 3 year old and we had no place to stay or go. Condo is so old and outdated, dirty and the Door! Let me tell you about the door situation- Dead bolts every where that dont work. 14 step process to get into and out of the condo. The door to the beach has no rollers and will not open. I am 6'3\", 225lbs and I could barely open it up. The lock on the door falls down on you and locks you out onto the BEACH! Oceano claims they have remodeled and replaced the door but we have rented the unit next door several times and know for a fact that door has done this to every group that has stayed there. Beds are so hard the y might as well be concrete. NEVER AGAIN- I have been raised in rocky point going there 3-4 times a year since I was 8! Over 30 years and dont expect much. We are not snobby condo renters, just appreciate the basics- fair beds, clean and timely service - wont get that with this unit. Not sure if all experiences are the same with Oceano so cant comment there but can tell you the property just needs some tlc. good luck!   "},{"title":"Luna y Sol","city":"Mesa","state":"AZ","comment":"I wouldn't recommend this rental property"},{"title":"Run down","city":"Tucson","state":"Arizona","comment":"Totally run down property - doors look like they have been busted several times - good for campers - mattress in the main bedroom is comparable to sleeping on a row of wires - thank goodness the heater works because it is a very drafty place - fire place need some servicing to insure the smoke go outside when you burn some wood - all furniture are missing a piece ( probably 50 years old in very poor condition) - two out of four burners on the stove work, and forget the oven!!!\u003cbr/\u003eThis place has all the basics for survival but absolutely nothing else. "},{"title":"Unit 13 at Mirador","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"The original condo we had booked was having electrical problems, so we were moved to #13 at Mirador. It was lacking the following items: toaster,broom (it was broken), hangers, patio table.  My son received an electrical shock when he touched the shower knobs in the bathroom closest to the garage.  The lock latch on the sliding glass door self-latched when we closed the door from outside, so we were locked out.  Fortunately, we had left the front door unlocked.  The mattresses were very uncomfortable."},{"title":"Nice and Pleasant..","city":"Victorville","state":"CA","comment":"Very private family condo, we loved the fact of steping out of the condo directly into the sand and the ocean. Nicely ubicated if you want to relax and enjoy quiet time. Our group was made of adults and  toddlers, we all enjoyed our stay. My kids 3 \u0026#38; 4 yr. Old loved it. A couple of things we were not satisfied with were the bedroom that isnt attached to the home,since it had no heating system and the nights were cold;warm blankets were available and that compensated for it. The other thing was the chairs to laydown and watch the sunset, two of three were broken, requested replacements, but they never made it. Finally, if wifi is important to you, this isnt a place for you. I wanted a get away from everything and enjoy myself, nature and family  and this fit my needs just fine. Overall, I would reserve it again."},{"title":"Mixed Reviews 1-5","city":"San Tan Valley","state":"AZ","comment":"Great beach. Great condo for the dollar amount. right next to the club section, pink Cadillac, Ice House, and section bar/ club. If your going there to party and sleep during the day, I strongly recommend this place.We had blaring music until 3-4 am every morning, bass was shaking the windows. \u003cbr/\u003eThe beach was very nice and clean, with dolphins passing in the am, and a good beach atmosphere. The condo was cheap... and for the money it was very good. 3rd time to rocky point and I have very good luck with Oceano Rentals every time. The other places I have stayed (Beach wise) have been much quieter. But it was a great trip.

Sometimes the houses are not up to par - that was the case this time. Oceano said the property owners nephew lives in town and maintains this property - he is NOT doing a good job.  None of the electric kitchen appliances worked, (except coffee pot), there was no broom on the property, the window in the very back bedroom is not seated correctly allowing lots of cold air into that room, the mattresses are old and sad, there is no hot water in the middle hall bathroom, the heat on the bedroom side of the house only worked the first night we were there, the toilet in the master bedroom does not flush, the front gates are broken, the window coverings are all broken, there are only chaise lounges for the patio, no chairs, the lock on the guest house is hard to lock.  The house is on a great part of the beach and Oceano is good to work with, but, this house is not great.  Ask Oceano to direct you to a better property unless you are just there to party and don't really care about the accommodations.  "},{"title":"Awesome Get-Away!!","city":"Gilbert","state":"AZ","comment":"We recently enjoyed staying here for 4 days in October. The home had everything we needed and in a perfect location of Las Conchas. We enjoyed the large patio and spacious kitchen the most. The furniture is dated and some pieces should be replaced. Picturesque views of the sunset is worth paying to stay right on the beach. It suited our needs perfectly. "},{"title":"Spacious but quite run down","city":"Saint George","state":"UT","comment":"We have rented through Oceano many times and had a great experience. This time, not as much. Oceano was helpful, as always, but the property itself is quite substandard. The main door out to the sea did not function properly at first and within a day, not at all. The main complaint everyone had was the plumbing - we don't expect American plumbing on the beach in Mexico, but toilets that constantly clog etc are very off-putting. Oceano tried to fix them, but without much success. The general condition of the property is good, but dilapidated. We loved the spaciousness of the property and the location on the beach, but the plumbing was a huge disappointment."},{"title":"Home is in Horrible Condition ","city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","comment":"The main door to the back patio is inoperable, they have old golf clubs stuck in the doors for locks. The window coverings do not open in order to enjoy the ocean view, many rooms have sheets nailed to them! The faucet handles in most of the bathrooms do not work. The kitchen is horribly horribly stocked with required cooking utensils. The mattresses are horribly uncomfortable and really gross, they are literally falling apart with plastic wrapped around them to keep them together. The sheets are what you would imagine would be used in a prison. The electrical panel is in the foyer of the house which is exposed and dangerous. The back patio has furniture that is falling apart and you literally fall through when you sit down. This place needs a remodel and repairs before it is put back in the rental pool, it shouldn't have been a rental for a very long time it appears. If you have small children the back is very dangerous with holes around the stairs and edge of the sand, the design they used for the wall is dangerous. The stairs off the patio are so deep it is almost impossible for children to climb, the sand off the patio, which would be considered their yard has so much garbage and debris desperately needs to be cleaned up because you cannot walk barefoot without cutting your feet. DO NOT RENT!"},{"title":"Great home ","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","comment":"We loved this house!  The home was clean and everything worked the way it was supposed to.  We will rent this property again.  "},{"title":"BE WARNED","city":"Surprise","state":"AZ","comment":"This house is in need of some serious attention. I'm not one to normally write reviews, but here are the FACTS. We had 3 families sharing the house and while the size and location are great, the house itself seems VERY neglected. ALL the beds throughout the house are VERY OLD, SQUEAKY \u0026#38; UNCOMFORTABLE (no one slept well). The house had NO simple amenities such as... 5 gallon water dispenser, hand/kitchen towels, broom, hose, floor mats. Don't bother BBQ'ing, there is NO grate to cook on. The shower is towards the front of the house, not down by the beach, so there's no place to wash off any sand when you come off the beach. Seems pretty clear that the owner of this house NEVER spends anytime here. Furniture is old, the whole house is run down and has no charm. One positive is that the AC blew cold all week! I've stayed at many places in Rocky Point over the past 20 years.... I'll never stay here again!"},{"title":"Palmeras 2015 Review","city":"Peoria","state":"Arizona","comment":"The location was just what we wanted after previous rentals in Los Conchas.

When we checked in Friday evening and went to the unit the AC was not on and it was about 100 Degrees in the unit. There was 2 small window air conditioners, ne in the living room/kitchen/dining room area and one in the bedroom. By keeping the bedroom door closed we able to keep the bedroom tolerable, there was not a thermometer but I would guess it was about 80 degrees in the bedroom after 12 hours or so. The rest f the house was extremely hot all weekend and was still about 90 when we left Sunday. The bathroom had no cooling at all and remained very hot and humid.\u003cbr/\u003eContinental breakfast was supposed to be included in the common area that also has Satellite TV, games etc but no breakfast was provided Saturday morning and the wall Air Conditioner which requires a remote to operate was not turned on and the room was unbearable. I called the management company and by that that night someone had turned on the AC unit but and put a couple of danish and small chocolate milks in the fridge.\u003cbr/\u003eThe unit was not very clean not terrible but dirt in the corners, could use some TLC and it had a terrible smell in it that did not go away over the weekend. My wife thought it smelled like an exterminator sprayed but possibly it was something that had been cooked there.\u003cbr/\u003eIt is about a 2 block walk to the beach.\u003cbr/\u003eThere where other small issues but they are really irrelevant when looking at the big picture. While it is a pretty property I can not recommend it. In fact we moved to another house on Monday with Central AC and it was heaven.\u003cbr/\u003eMaybe in cooler weather it would be

Music blaring until after 330 am. House needs serious repairs and upgrades. Master bathroom wouldnt flush properly. Shower in hall wouldn't work properly. Tiles loose on sinks, in shower. Paint was chipping. Place looked like it had been empty/abandoned for sometime. Beds were uncomfortable. Linens looked like they needed to be washed and could definitely be replaced! The house didnt have a broom or mop! TV didnt work. House had a foul odor to it, had to go out and buy candles and air freshener. Would not recommend this to anyone at any price. A little money invested into this property would make the location seem more bare-able.

However, we did not know that we were in 'the entertainment district' which meant that from 8:00 PM until 3:15 AM we had to listen to the bass and do from the club on the next block.  The bass resonates into the house, so there is no escaping it.  We tried closing everything up, but the beat was still there.  Also, the air conditioning had issues, so the coolest it got was 79 degrees.  It was the most miserable night ever.   We left the next morning at 9:00 AM.  Upon leaving, there was cups, beer cans and beer bottles thrown all along the street that is used to enter the property. It was really disgusting.  I suppose if we came down to party, this would have been the perfect spot, but we came down to relax and enjoy nature.  This was definitely not the place for us.

The house was beautiful. One of the rooms was warmer than the rest of the house, there were no instruction on how to use the Tv, DVD (with 5different remotes) very minor , but we had no running water at this property for the entire weekend; so we were not able to shower, brush our teeth or even use the bathroom in the house. We informed the property management 3times, and each time we were told it‚Äôs been fixed, but we still had no water. Finally on Sunday when we checked out we informed them again that we had no water the entire weekend, we were told it‚Äôs a City problem, but all other properties had running water except for ours.   Luckily we traveled with family and were able to use their shower and bathroom. We made the best of it but it was very disappointing and the management didn‚Äôt even try to make it right or attempt to validate why were upset and disappointed.

It looked nothing like the pictures.We drove by a couple of times expecting to find what was in the photos. We were not allowed to use garages. Glass doors were broken including sliding glass door that was used as the main door. Shower heads were broken grill was unusable no patio seats the bathroom locks didn't work we got stuck in the bathroom had to take knob off. One ac unit didn't work the house is falling apart.The house would be very nice if kept up lots of potential."},{"title":"Dream by the Sea Stay 2016","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","comment":"We have absolutely NO COMPLAINTS about maintenance or the rental agents. This is only intended to describe the property and the areas that were unsatisfactory. The property is located very far from the entrance. It is very poorly kept. Most windows and doors are either cracked or do not shut property letting in ants and whatever bugs are around. The AC doesn't seem to work properly in one of the rooms. The kitchen is not well equipped and many of the kitchen cabinet doors are broken. The paint on the exterior is in terrible state and we never felt safe to climb up the stairs leading up to the balcony.  They literally are falling apart and the railing consists of pvc pipes only! Upon our arrival we noticed ants crawling from a back door into the kitchen, all over the counter and stove and to one of the bedrooms. Maintenance took care of the problem right away. Our stay was great because Rocky Point has always been our top destination for family vacations. The property was the worst we have rented since we started coming to Rocky Point 8 years ago. We would not rent this particular home again."}],"stay_ranges":[{"start":"2/10/2016","end":"22/11/2016","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"23/11/2016","end":"27/11/2016","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"28/11/2016","end":"21/12/2016","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"22/12/2016","end":"25/12/2016","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"26/12/2016","end":"28/12/2016","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"29/12/2016","end":"2/1/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"3/1/2017","end":"23/3/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"24/3/2017","end":"3/4/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"4/4/2017","end":"12/4/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"13/4/2017","end":"16/4/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"17/4/2017","end":"25/5/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"26/5/2017","end":"29/5/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"30/5/2017","end":"29/6/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"30/6/2017","end":"4/7/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"5/7/2017","end":"31/8/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"1/9/2017","end":"4/9/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":250},{"start":"5/9/2017","end":"1/10/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195},{"start":"2/10/2017","end":"21/11/2017","stay_type":"Nightly","price":195}]}]
